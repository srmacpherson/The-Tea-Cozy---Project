# The-Tea-Cozy---Project
My first 'big' project. To create a website following a designer brief.
This is one of Codecademy's project tasks where the brief was to produce a website. 
Most of the specifications of the page were set in stone.
This was a considerable challenge, where I had to search online, revise my notes and complete plenty of trial and error efforts. 
However, whilst my code could most-likely be streamlined and made to be more visually cohesive, I am proud to have created this website and to have overcome the many obstacles that it provided.
